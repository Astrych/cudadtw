The complete source code including the used datasets can be found on the left side at the corresponding github repository.\r\n## z-Normalized Subsequence Euclidean Distance\r\nOur proposed implementation of the locally z-normalized alignment of time series subsequences in a stream of time series data makes excessive use of Fast Fourier Transforms on the GPU. The CUDA-parallelization features log-linear runtime in terms of the stream lengths and is almost independent of the query length. As a result, arbitrarily long queries can be performed without increasing of the runtime.\r\n![ecg benchmark](https://raw.github.com/gravitino/GPU-Suite/master/images/edecg.png)\r\n![metal benchmark](https://raw.github.com/gravitino/GPU-Suite/master/images/edmetal.png)\r\n## z-Normalized Subsequence Dynamic Time Warping with Sakoe-Shiba Constraint\r\n![DTW diagonal scheme](https://raw.github.com/gravitino/GPU-Suite/master/images/dtwdiagscheme.png)\r\n![ecg benchmark](https://raw.github.com/gravitino/GPU-Suite/master/images/dtwecg.png)\r\n![metal benchmark](https://raw.github.com/gravitino/GPU-Suite/master/images/dtwmetal.png)\r\n\r\n# Data Sets\r\n\r\n## ECG\r\n![ecg data set](https://raw.github.com/gravitino/GPU-Suite/master/images/ecg_sub_ed.png)\r\n\r\n## Metal\r\n![metal data set](https://raw.github.com/gravitino/GPU-Suite/master/images/steel.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
